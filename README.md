### **1. Introduction to Linux**

#### **Overview**
Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is known for its versatility, security, and wide usage in both server and desktop environments. Common Linux distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Debian, each serving different needs from desktop users to large-scale servers.

#### **Linux Kernel and Architecture**
Linux follows a modular architecture, with the Linux kernel being the core of the operating system, responsible for handling hardware interactions, memory management, and system calls.

### **2. File System Navigation**

#### **Understanding the File Structure**
The Linux file system is hierarchical, starting from the root directory `/`. Common directories include:
- `/home`: Home directories for users.
- `/etc`: Configuration files.
- `/var`: Variable files such as logs.
- `/bin`: Essential command binaries.

#### **Commands for File System Navigation**
| **Command** | **Description**              | **Example**                       |
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `pwd`       | Prints the current directory  | `pwd`                            |
| `ls`        | Lists files and directories   | `ls -al`                         |
| `cd`        | Changes directory             | `cd /home/user`                  |
| `find`      | Finds files based on criteria | `find / -name "example.txt"`      |

**In-depth Usage:**
```bash
pwd  # Displays the current working directory, e.g., /home/user
ls -l  # Displays files and directories in long format with details
cd /etc  # Navigate to the /etc directory
find / -name "*.conf"  # Find all .conf files in the system
```

### **3. File and Directory Management**

#### **Commands for Managing Files and Directories**
These commands allow you to create, move, copy, delete, and manipulate files.

| **Command**      | **Description**               | **Example**                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `touch`          | Creates an empty file          | `touch file.txt`                 |
| `mkdir`          | Creates a new directory        | `mkdir new_dir`                  |
| `cp`             | Copies files/directories       | `cp file.txt /backup/`           |
| `mv`             | Moves or renames files         | `mv file.txt newfile.txt`        |
| `rm`             | Deletes files                 | `rm file.txt`                    |
| `rmdir`          | Deletes an empty directory     | `rmdir empty_dir`                |

**Example Usage:**
```bash
touch newfile.txt  # Creates an empty file called newfile.txt
mkdir new_folder   # Creates a directory called new_folder
cp file.txt /backup/  # Copies file.txt to the backup folder
mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt  # Renames oldfile.txt to newfile.txt
rm unwantedfile.txt  # Deletes unwantedfile.txt
```

### **4. File Permissions and Ownership**

#### **Understanding Linux File Permissions**
Linux uses a set of permissions that determine who can read, write, or execute a file or directory. Each file has three permission categories:
- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: A set of users that share the same permissions.
- **Others**: Everyone else.

Each permission is represented as:
- **r**: Read
- **w**: Write
- **x**: Execute

#### **Numeric Representation (Octal Notation)**
Permissions are also represented using numbers:
- **r** = 4
- **w** = 2
- **x** = 1

The permission `rwx` for a file owner would translate to `7` (4+2+1). For each file, you need to specify permissions for owner, group, and others, like this:
- `chmod 755 file.txt` results in:
  - Owner: rwx (7)
  - Group: r-x (5)
  - Others: r-x (5)

#### **Common Permissions Explained:**
| **Permission** | **Symbol** | **Octal** | **Description**                     |
|----------------|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| `rwxrwxrwx`    | Full access | `777`     | Everyone can read, write, execute   |
| `rw-r--r--`    | Owner can read/write | `644` | Owner can read/write, others can read |
| `rwxr-xr-x`    | Owner full, group/others read/execute | `755` | Owner can read/write/execute, others can read/execute |

#### **Changing Permissions and Ownership**
| **Command**      | **Description**               | **Example**                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `chmod`          | Change file permissions       | `chmod 755 file.txt`             |
| `chown`          | Change file ownership         | `chown user:group file.txt`      |
| `ls -l`          | View file permissions         | `ls -l file.txt`                 |

**Example Usage:**
```bash
chmod 644 myfile.txt  # Grants read/write to owner, read-only to others
chown john:staff myfile.txt  # Change ownership of myfile.txt to user john and group staff
```

|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `ps`             | Display running processes      | `ps aux`                         |
| `top`            | Display real-time system info  | `top`                            |
| `kill`           | Terminate a process by PID     | `kill 1234`                      |
| `htop`           | Interactive process viewer     | `htop`                           |

**Example Usage:**
```bash

ping google.com  # Tests connectivity to google.com
netstat -tuln  # Displays listening network ports and connections
```

### **7. Shell Scripting**

#### **What is Shell Scripting?**
Shell scripts are simple text files containing commands that are executed in sequence by the shell (bash). They are often used to automate repetitive tasks.

#### **Example Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple script to check disk usage
df -h | grep "/dev/sda"
```

#### **Basic Scripting Concepts:**
| **Command**      | **Description**               | **Example**                       |
